# BDA-and-tools

A collection of big data analysis tools and experiments for learning and exploration.

## About

This repository serves as a study space for experimenting with various big data and machine learning tools, including Apache Kafka, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and more. The primary goal is to learn and implement new algorithms and techniques, with a focus on hands-on experimentation and discovery.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* PyTorch
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* Manim (for video presentations)
* Apache Kafka
* Conda (for package management)

## Contents

This repository contains a variety of projects and experiments, including:

* **Kafka**: experiments with Apache Kafka, including producers, consumers, and data processing
* **PyTorch**: implementations of various PyTorch models, including linear regression, PCA, t-SNE, and more
* **Machine Learning**: experiments with scikit-learn, including linear regression, decision trees, clustering, and more
* **Data Visualization**: video presentations created using Manim to illustrate complex concepts and algorithms
* **Miscellaneous**: various other experiments and projects, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and more

## Note

This repository is intended for personal study and experimentation. While the code may be useful for others, it is not intended for production use.
